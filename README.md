# Jenkins_project
Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) with Jenkins and ArgoCD. I have successfully deployed a Java web application using a declarative CI/CD pipeline that incorporates various tools such as Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Docker, ArgoCD, and Kubernetes.

# Project Overview
The project entails the implementation of a robust Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins and ArgoCD for a Java web application. This pipeline automates crucial stages of the software development lifecycle, ensuring efficiency and reliability.

The CI/CD pipeline encompasses various essential components. Initially, Jenkins is configured with necessary plugins, while SonarQube is set up for continuous code analysis. Credentials for Docker Hub, GitHub, and SonarQube are integrated, facilitating seamless integration and authentication within the pipeline.

For deployment, a Kubernetes cluster is created using Minikube, and the ArgoCD operator is installed. This setup allows for automatic monitoring of the corresponding GitHub repository and efficient deployment of any detected changes to the cluster. This approach guarantees synchronization and streamlined updates.
